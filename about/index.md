Hi there! My name is Jennifer, and welcome to my website! 


## Background

I'm a senior [research software engineer](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/11317056-in-conversation-with-ben-goldacre) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I work between the [Institute of Health Informatics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-informatics/ucl-institute-health-informatics) and the [UCLH BRC Clinical Research Informatics Unit (CRIU)](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/clinical-research-informatics-unit) on designing and implementing AI-driven solutions in healthcare, in particular, applying natural language processing (NLP) for data extraction applications in electronic health record systems (EHRs).

I lead the software development on the [MiADE (Medical information AI Data Extractor)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-informatics/research/medical-information-ai-data-extractor-miade) project, an NLP system which supports the automatic extraction of structured data from real-time clinical notes. MiADE is currently deployed as a research service at UCLH and Great Ormond Street Hospitals (GOSH). I am also the technical lead on using large language models (LLMs) to optimise diagnoses extractions as part of a [UKRI AI Innovation research project](https://www.ukri.org/news/13-million-for-22-ai-for-health-research-projects/).

In July 2024, I founded [.implement](https://dotimplement.ai), a software and consulting company specialising in building developer tools for AI and NLP applications in healthcare. Having worked at the unique intersection of research and software development in the NHS, I believe there is a need for more robust and transparent testing, evaluation, and orchestration tools for AI applications in healthcare.

Previously, I was one of the first two hires on the developer team to launch [Grow Football](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/the-club/football-development/grow-football/), a computer vision-powered football coaching app with partnerships to Tottenham Hotspur.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science from [Imperial College London](https://www.ic.ac.uk/) and an MSc in Clinical Neuroscience from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I briefly worked in research on the [neural basis of spatial navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETaZAyK4IVM) at the [Barry lab](https://barry-lab.com/), where my interest in software and machine learning first developed. This led me to apply to one of the [most selective computer science conversion degrees](https://www.admissionreport.com/imperial-college-london/msc-computing-science), where I dabbled in deep learning and brain-computer interfaces. You can find my thesis [here](/assets/report.pdf).

In my spare time I enjoy weightlifting (my goal is to snatch 50kg), arthouse cinema (my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/thefilmpotato/)), and making my cat an influencer (follow [@ladywhiskerson](https://www.instagram.com/ladywhiskerson/)!)
